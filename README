DESCRIPTION:
Tomld (tomoyo learning daemon) is an extension to the Tomoyo security 
framework. Tomoyo increases security by confining applications and services 
into domains using rules. Tomld automates this process helping users harden 
their systems more easily. To do this tomld starts in learning mode, creates 
Tomoyo domains, collects rules, changes them and once the rules appear to be 
complete tomld enforces the policy.

The Tomoyo framework already has a learning mode which automatically sets up 
rules while processes are running. The problem for the user is that these 
processes use continuously changing files and directory names which have to be 
replaced by wildcarded rules. This requires an advanced knowledge of the system.

Tomld fully automates the MAC set up, allowing the average user to have a much 
more secure system with minimal effort. Currently this solution targets Linux 
systems only.

Tomoyo security module is part of the mainline Linux kernel since version 
2.6.30.

USAGE: tomld [options] [executables]

The following options are supported:
    -h   --help              **print this help
    -v   --version           **print version information
    -c   --color             colorize output
    -n   --notify  [command] run the command with appended info messages
                             (should be run on a desktop as normal user)
         --log        [file] redirect stderr and stdout to this file
         --no-crypt          disable lookup of mounted encrypted filesystems
         --no-domain [files] don't create domains for these executables
         --clear             clear domain configurations
                             (all previously learnt rules will be backed up)
         --reset             reinitialize domain configurations
                             (all previously learnt rules will be backed up)
    -l   --learn  [patterns] **request temporary learning mode for all domains,
                             or for those domains that match the patterns
                             (this is the recommended way if still necessary)
    -i   --info    [pattern] **print domains' rules by pattern
                             (without pattern, print a list of main domains)
    -r   --remove  [pattern] remove domains by pattern
    -R   --recursive  [dirs] replace subdirs of dirs with wildcards in rules
    -m   --manual            exiting from tomld for the second time switches
                             all old learning mode domains to enforcing mode
    -k   --keep              don't change domain's mode for this session
                             (learning mode domains will stay so on exit)
         --learn-all         switch all domains back to learning mode
                             (this is not advised, only for correction purposes)
         --mail      [users] send mail to users with recent deny logs
    -1   --once              quit after first cycle
         --yes               auto confirm everything with yes

*executables are additional programs to create domains for

**these options can be used simultaneously with a running tomld daemon

REQUIREMENTS:
Tomoyo enabled kernel (v2.6.30 and above) and tomoyo-tools (v2.2 and above)
