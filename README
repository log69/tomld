DESCRIPTION:
Tomld (tomoyo learning daemon) is an extension to the Tomoyo security 
framework. Tomoyo increases security by confining applications and services 
into domains using rules. Tomld automates this process helping users harden 
their systems more easily. To do this tomld starts in learning mode, creates 
Tomoyo domains, collects rules, changes them and once the rules appear to be 
complete tomld enforces the policy.

The Tomoyo framework already has a learning mode which automatically sets up 
rules while processes are running. The problem for the user is that these 
processes use continuously changing files and directory names which have to be 
replaced by wildcarded rules. This requires an advanced knowledge of the system.

Tomld tries to fully automate the MAC set up, allowing the average user to have 
a much more secure system with minimal effort.

Tomoyo security module is part of the mainline Linux kernel since version 
2.6.30. Currently this solution targets Linux systems only.

USAGE: tomld [options] [executables]

The following options are supported:
    -h   --help             print this help
    -v   --version          print version information
    -c   --color            colorize output
         --clear            clear domain configurations
         --reset            reinitialize domain configurations
                            (all previously learnt rules will be backed up)
    -i   --info   [pattern] print domains' rules by pattern
                            (without pattern, print a list of main domains)
    -r   --remove [pattern] remove domains by pattern
    -m   --manual           exiting from tomld for the second time turns
                            all old learning mode domains into enforcing mode
    -R   --recursive [dirs] replace subdirs of dirs in rules with wildcards
    -k   --keep             don't change domain's mode for this session
                            (learning mode domains will stay so on exit)
    -l   --learn            turn learning mode back for all domains
                            (this is not advised, only for correction purposes)
    -1   --once             quit after first cycle
                            (might be useful for scripts)
         --yes              auto confirm everything with yes

*executables are additional programs to create domains for

requirements: Tomoyo enabled kernel (v2.6.30 - 2.6.39) and tomoyo-tools (v2.2.x 
- 2.3.x)
